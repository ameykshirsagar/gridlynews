jQuery plugin for loading news feed in grid

This plugin is till in beta. I just wanted to implement my vision of watching news in grid layout. I am still working on

adding custom options for this plugin. Currently you may use options for modifying the RSS feed. The API is availabale at

http://www.zazar.net/developers/jquery/zrssfeed/

Only use the parameters

Additional customisations can be done in CSS


Usage-

$('#menu').gridlynews('http://feeds.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/highlights/tv/list',{
		snippet: false,
	});
